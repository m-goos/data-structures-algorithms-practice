## Resources with walkthrough solutions

Mostly, I'm able to solve the problems within the given time limit. But as the problems get a bit harder, my initial solution is usually not the most _efficient_ way to solve the problem. That's perfectly normal, but it's important to get an idea of what a more efficient solution looks like.

Start with the _reading material_ that codility provides with the problems. Then look at your solution again and see where it can be optimized. Map your solution to the theory - is there any overlap? Next is looking at how others solve the problem. As you go over various problems for a concept, some patterns and the first bit of intuition emerge.

A helpful youtube collection for seeing alternative, mostly elegant and brief solutions for the `codility` challenges in `JavaScript`:

There are playlists available that walk through all problems in `python`, `Java` and even `php`.
