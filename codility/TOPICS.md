## Resources with walkthrough solutions

I tend to get the solutions for most problems right. But as the problems get a bit harder, my first solution is not usually the most _efficient_ way to solve the problem. That's perfectly normal, but it's important to get an idea of what a more efficient solution looks like.

Start with the _reading material_ provided by codility with the problems. Then look at your solution again and see where it can be optimized. Next is looking at how other people solve the problem.

Helpful youtube collection for seeing alternative, mostly elegant and brief solutions for the `codility` challenges:

- JavaScript [Codility walkthrough playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqDHFR_FjG5-rH6Bg5xYMR-HTmSOqyF-L) (by Fresh Code Soda).

There are playlists available that walk through all problems in `python`, `Java` and even `php`.
