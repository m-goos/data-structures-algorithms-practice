# code-puzzle-practice

Simple solutions for code puzzles (leetcode-style) in NodeJS. These are first iterations, they have not been optimized for execution speed.

To run:

```sh
# ts-node runs TypeScript directly
npm i -g ts-node

# nodemon watches a file, so it keeps refreshing output in the console
npm i -g nodemon

# execute code
nodemon myPuzzle.ts
```
